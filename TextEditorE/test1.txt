Alternatively, we can use \Q and \E to escape the special character. \Q indicates that all
characters up to \E needs to be escaped and \E means we need to end the escaping that was started with \Q.

This just means that whatever is in between \Q and \E would be escaped.

In the test shown here, the split() of the String class does a match using the regular expression provided to it.

Our requirement is to split the input string by the pipe (|) character into words. Therefore, we use a regular
expression pattern to do so.

The pipe character is a metacharacter that needs to be escaped in the regular expression.

Here, the escaping is done by placing the pipe character between \Q and \E:
